# Calculator App

> This project was created as a means to practice front end web development skills. It was written in HTML/CSS/Javascript and bundled with Vite. It is designed to be responsive and accessible across all devices, and features both mouse and keyboard support.

> In addition to creating a pixel-perfect rendition from design documents, this project also gave me an opportunity to deepen my knowledge and understanding of keyboard and mouse event handling.

> Working with SCSS to create dynamic themes keeps the codebase light, simple, and human readable.
